#### Introduction to JSX
> JSX allows writing Markup in JavaScript. It's a utility that helps developers create React components quickly and seamlessly.
* Code: `LessonJSX`

#### React Elements
> Elements are the basic building blocks of React apps. They represent how DOM should look like at a certain time.
* Code: `LessonElements`

**Study Links**:
* [Rendering Elements](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html)

___

#### Components and Props
> Components can be used to build complete views in React. Each component needs some data to display or to work with.
This data is known as Props.
* Code: `LessonCompProps`

#### State and Lifecycle
> React's state allows us sto store and manipulate data in a component. Lifecycle hooks enable us to perform operations during certain points in the execution lifecycle of the component.
* Code: `LessonStateLifeHooks`

___
#### Event Handling in React
> Similar to DOM event handling with a few convention differences as well as knowledge of binding functions with classes.
* Code: `Lessons.js` / `LessonState.js` / `LessonHooks.js` / `Profile.js`
